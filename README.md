# myCommuter
My first Android app to help simplify the process of retreiving the realtime tracking of the ACTransit bus on a given route.

The realtime tracking is available as a REST service under services.my511.org/Transit2.0/GetNextDeparturesByStopCode.aspx

This android app loads up with a preset settings of the SB bus line (this was the sweet 1.5 hr long, moving at a snail pace, but better than BART, commute) 
and renders the time that the bus is away from my designated stop.
